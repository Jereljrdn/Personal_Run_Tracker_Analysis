# Personal Run Tracker Analysis

This project explores my personal running data collected from the **Nike Run Club** app, enhanced with **historical weather data** pulled from the [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/). The goal is to evaluate how factors such as **temperature**, **elevation gain** and **cadence** may have influenced my running performance (measured by average pace).

## Project Objective
To combine running performance metrics with weather and environmental data to:
- Understand what variables have the biggest impact on my running pace.
- Visualize these relationships through statistical plots.
- Practice ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), API integration, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Excel, Python, and R

## Tools
- **Microsoft Excel** â€“ Used as the input and output format for the dataset. Run data from the Nike Run Club app was manually logged here and the final merged dataset (with weather data) was exported back to Excel to prepare for analysis and visualization.
- **Python** â€“ Used to read and clean data from the Excel spreadsheet (`pandas`), retrieve historical weather conditions from WeatherAPI (`requests`), merge the weather data with the original dataset, and export the final dataset as a new Excel file.
- **WeatherAPI** â€“ A free weather data API used to retrieve weather data such as temperature and condition based on a run's date, time, and location.
- **R** â€“ Used for cleaning, transforming, visualizing and analyzing data. Explored potential relationships between pace and variables like temperature, elevation gain, and cadence. 

## Analysis
- Calculated **Pearson correlation coefficients** between average pace and **temperature**, **elevation gain**, and **cadence**.
- Built a **linear regression model** to evaluate which variables have the strongest influence on running pace.
- Filtered out extreme outliers (e.g., marathon) to avoid skewed analysis.

## Visualization

### Plots comparing pace against various factors:

![](Plots/cadence_vs_pace.png)

Cadence showed a strong **negative correlation (-0.94)** with average pace. Higher cadence resulted in faster runs.

![](Plots/elevation_vs_pace.png)

Elevation had a **mild correlation (.074)** with pace. Slight increases in elevation gain had a tendancy to slow down pace.

![](Plots/temperature_vs_pace.png)

A **weak to moderate positive correlation (0.31)** . Higher temperatures generally slowed me down, likely due to heat fatigue.

## Summary of Findings

- **Cadence** had the **strongest correlation** with pace. Improving cadence could be the most impactful training metric.
- **Elevation** showed a minor correltion with pace, especially on hilly routes, but it wasnâ€™t a major driver overall.
- **Temperature** had some influence on pace. Runs in hotter conditions had a tendancy to slow down pace.

These insights can help guide future training, such as focusing on stride and avoiding hot or hilly conditions for speed-focused workouts.

## Data Files

Two Excel files are included in the `Data/` folder to support full reproducibility of the project:

- `RunTimes.xlsx`:  
  The original dataset, manually logged from the Nike Run Club app. Includes metrics like distance, pace, elevation, cadence, and city.

- `RunTimes_WithWeather.xlsx`:  
  Generated by the Python script. Combines the original run data with historical weather information (temperature, condition) retrieved from WeatherAPI.

These datasets include real running stats but do **not** contain GPS routes or personal identifying details (Yes, I'm a bit of a slow runner ðŸ˜‚ But thats the point of improving!).

## How to Reproduce This Project

1. **Download or clone this repository.**
2. Make sure the `RunTimes.xlsx` file is located in the `/Data` folder.
3. Run the **WeatherData_Source.py** Python script to:
   - Fetch historical weather data from WeatherAPI.
   - Merge it with original 'RunTimes.xlsx' excel file
   - Create a new enhanced dataset called 'RunTimes_WithWeather' in the '/Data' folder.
   > *When you run the Python script, you will be prompted to enter your **WeatherAPI key**, which you can obtain by creating a free account at [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/).*
4. Open and run the **'RunAnalysisScript'** R file to:
   - Clean and analyze the updated dataset
   - Produce plots (saved to '/Plots' folder) and model output (saved to '/Output' folder). This will save all plots in '/Plots' folder.
